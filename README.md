# Kaggle_Rossman_Sales_Predicitions
Using RandomForest to predict Sales at Rossman(Kaggle Competition)

This notebook is meant to show the performance of a robust ensemble methods ; Random Forest (parallel tree creation) and evaluate the best performing one for this case.

I will walk you through my thoughts of how did i approach this problem, i will then explore and find interesting insights on the data provided from Rossman in order to understand better our features and to identify the pattern hidden in the data to finally be able to choose what variables goes into the model and how should i tweak the parameters to get a robust predictive model.
